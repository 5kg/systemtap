# The test format is basically stolen from glibc's regex testsuite. 
# Each line has format <expected outcome>:<regexp>:<match string>.

# 0 means match should succeed:
0:abc:abc
0:s*:ssss

# 1 means match should fail:
1:abc:zb
1:abc:ab

# 2 means regex compilation should fail (cleanly):
2:[:abc

# FIXME -- matching should not be left-anchored by default
0:abc:zabc

# FIXME -- indefinite repetition should not fail via reading past the end
0:.*:stuffs

# FIXME -- make sure the following works correctly (however it's supposed to)
2:$^:
2:$.*:
# TODO -- what's the right thing to do for the above??
1:$a^:a
1:$.*:a
